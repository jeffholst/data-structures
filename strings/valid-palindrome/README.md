# Problem

Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

#### Example
	"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" is a palindrome
	"race a car" is not a palindrome

#### Program Structure:
    public class Solution {
	    public bool isPalindrome(String s)
		{

		}
    }

#### Solution:
    This can be solved easily by using the 'reverse' method in certain programming languages.  For our solution we'll use another approach.

    See valid-palindrome-lib/Class1.cs
###  Space Complexity: O(N):
	This does not use any extra space.  Hence the space complexity is O(1)

#### Difficulty: Easy
